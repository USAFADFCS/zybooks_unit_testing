# zybooks_unit_testing
Unit test framework for CS110 Zybooks python programming

You will need to add the shared_functions to the zybooks unit test for the framework files to work correctly.
After adding the shared_functions copy and paste the approate framework into the unit test replacing the current content.
The file will then need several modifications depending on the test:
  
  Update test_inputs as needed
  Update the answer you are expecting in the variable
  Update the variable\function name you are looking for
  Update the patch "builtins.input" line
  Update the variable type in the check_variable function
  Update the feedback messages as needed
